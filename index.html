      I know we have not known each other for long, but I am really glad I got to meet you.
      You already seem like such a beautiful person, inside and out,
      and I just wanted to wish you an amazing day filled with smiles, good vibes, and cake.

      I hope this new year brings you exciting moments, great memories,
      and everything you are hoping for.

      Enjoy your day, you deserve it 💕
